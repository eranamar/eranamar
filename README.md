## TheoryLunch - Computer Science Topics Over Lunch

This repository holds the static files behind the [TheoryLunch](http://eranamar.github.io) blog, enter the link to view the posts. 
The idea for this blog was originated during one of my daily lunch meeting with friends from Weizmann Institute of Science.
I figured that some of our lunch-discussions are suitable as post subjects in a blog, so I created the TheoryLunch blog to be a platform for sharing those discussions. 

I am using jekyll as the static site generator.
